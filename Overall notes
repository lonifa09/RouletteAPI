Step 1.
1. Made a backup of the Northwind db and placed in the Git Repository
2. Resore the db and execute the stored procedure.

Step 2.
Implemented the four APIs as requested:
- PlaceBet
- Spin
- Payout
- ShowPreviousSpins

What I have missed
1. Global Exception Handling
2. Unit Tests, I totally have no experience with this but I know with time I will get it.
3. Dapper, I also have no experience with it.

I have also created Notes file in the Project folder.
